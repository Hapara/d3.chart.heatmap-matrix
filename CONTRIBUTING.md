# Contributing

All contribution is most welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests,
explaining what change you made & why.

## Development Environment

You need to install Grunt to develop, either globally or locally.
Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages, then:

  * `grunt` will build the files in `dist`;
  * or, `grunt dev` will watch your files and recompile on changes.

The last solution is useful for development. You can open your browser on
the `example/index.html` file and see your changes along the way.

The chart is written in [LiveScript](http://livescript.net/), pretty similar
to CoffeeScript.

## Style Guide

  * All files are `lower-case-dashed.foo`;
  * 4-space indentation;
  * 80 columns max.
