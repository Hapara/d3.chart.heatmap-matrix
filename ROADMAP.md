# Roadmap

  * add support for slanted headers (especially for columns) while keeping
    simplicity of implementation;
  * add a proper test suite;
  * try to improve performance with a lot of bubbles (allowing disabling
    move animations, maybe? or disable by ourselves when we see that
    columns or rows did not change, only bubble data);
  * publish on `bower` once `d3.chart` is itself published;
  * minify the CSS? useful or not, given most people minify themselves?
  * make sure AMD is working (and add a test for it).
